Packages
--------
[Arch Linux](http://www.archlinux.org) is our distro of choice, and the distro we use for testing.

You can find [PKGBUILDS](http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?K=uzbl) on the AUR
for all subprojects and for both the master and experimental branches.

For other distros, see [uzbl.org/wiki/howtos](http://www.uzbl.org/wiki/howtos)

From source
-----------
You can pull the code from git or get a tagged tarball.

	$ git clone git://github.com/Dieterbe/uzbl.git
	[ $ git checkout origin/experimental ] # optional. see below
	$ cd uzbl
	$ make
	$ sudo make install
If you want to remove uzbl again, you can issue:

	$ make uninstall

Tarballs can be pulled from [github.com/Dieterbe/uzbl/downloads](http://github.com/Dieterbe/uzbl/downloads)

Though you can only get tagged versions from the master branch, which may be older then what you'll have through git.

If you want the specific subprojects, you can issue:

	$ sudo make install-uzbl-core
	$ sudo make install-uzbl-browser
	$ sudo make install-uzbl-tabbed
